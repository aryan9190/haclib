### ðŸªŸ Windows Docker Users â€” Special Note

If you're on Windows and see an error like:

```[Error: SQLITE_CANTOPEN: unable to open database file]```


That means SQLite can't create or write to the default `./haclib.db` file inside the Docker container â€” a common issue on Windows due to file permission behavior in Docker volumes.

#### To Fix This:

1. **Update your `docker-compose.yaml` to add a writable volume:**

```
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data
```

2. **Create a data/ folder locally in your project root:**

```mkdir data```

3. **Update your db.js file so the database path is absolute inside the container:**

```filename: "/app/data/haclib.db"```
